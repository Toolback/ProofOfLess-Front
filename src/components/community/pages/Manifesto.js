                <p className="Manifesto-Texte">We’ve been told seeking happiness and progress are intrinsically tied to economic growth. As result we've been conditioned to constantly be chasing for MORE.
                    More glory.
                    More power.
                    More things.
                    More speed.
                    More money.
                    More friends.
                    More confort.
                    More intensity.
                    More entertainment.
                    …
                    More and more.

                    Humanity's greatest feature and flaw.

                    As a species our drive for more enabled so much progress and improved so many lives. The acceleration that we've seen in recent years is what turned that amazing feature into our biggest flaw.
                    Farming earth ressources like there is no tomorrow has brought us to a point of no return.
                    The promise of more planets on which we can live is hazardous and one that only a few will be able to afford.
                    Scarcity will inevitably impose us to have and do LESS.
                    We believe this is an amazing opportunity to (re)learn sobriety and frugality.
                    Introducing PROOF OF LESS.
                    The blockchain proved to be an amazing coordination mechanism. With Proof of Less we want to work these powerful incentives to work for the greater good.
                    What if web3 had the power to reward people who prove they do less of something harmful for the planet and society ?
                    We tokenized scarcity with Bitcoin,  automated trust with Ethereum, who says we can't tokenize sobriety.
                    Because we believe happiness can also come from LESS.
                    Less entertainment.
                    Less intensity.
                    Less confort.
                    Less friends.
                    Less money.
                    Less speed.
                    Less things.
                    Less power.
                    Less glory.
                    Less is more.
                    Our goal is to prove it.
